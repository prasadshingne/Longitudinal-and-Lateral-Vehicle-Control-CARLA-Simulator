# Longitudinal-and-Lateral-Vehicle-Control-CARLA-Simulator

This is the final project in the Course 1 - Introduction to Self Driving Cars of the Self-Driving Car Specialization offered by Coursera

Note: According to Coursera's Honor Code none of the solutions can be shared in contrast to Udacity hence I am only sharing the results.

1. Coursera_Proj1_CARLA-low_bt_rate.mp4 - Movie shows the vehicle track the speed and waypoints after the controller is written and tuned.
2. Speed_Profiles.png -  Shows the desired, simulated and acceptable range of vehicle speed in m/s.
3. Waypoints_and_solution.png - Shows the desired and simulated waypoints in two dimensions, x and y co-ordinates in m.
4. brake_outout.png - Shows the brake actuator values throughout the simulation, set to zero throughout as the desired result can be achieved without brake actuation.
5. forward_speed.png - Shows the desired and simulated vehicle speed in m/s.
6. steer_output.png - Shows the controller steering input normalized to between +/- 1.
7. throttle_output.png - Shows the controller throttle input between 0 and 1.
8. trajectory.png - Shows the desired and simulated vehicle trajectory.
